# Neural Latents -- Self-Supervised Neural Data Transformers
This repository contains the code my ECE 695 - Generative Models final project.

## Setup Instructions
This repository uses `anaconda` to create its python environment. 
I recommend you install a [miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) distribution.

Once you have `anaconda` installed, setup the environment using the following:
```sh
$ conda create -n nlatents python=3.12
$ conda activate nlatents
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ conda install ipykernel # use this if you will be looking at the notebooks.
```

(This should work, hopefully.)
