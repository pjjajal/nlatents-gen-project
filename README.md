# Neural Latents - Self-Supervised Neural Data Transformers
This repository contains the code my ECE 695 - Generative Models final project.
This work will train [Neural Data Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01210) using self-supervised learning. 

The model will be trained and tested on the data provided from [Neural Latents](https://neurallatents.github.io/).

## Setup Instructions
This repository uses `anaconda` to create its python environment. 
I recommend you install a [miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) distribution.

Once you have `anaconda` installed, setup the environment using the following:
```sh
$ conda create -n nlatents python=3.12
$ conda activate nlatents
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ conda install ipykernel # use this if you will be looking at the notebooks.
```

(This should work, hopefully.)
